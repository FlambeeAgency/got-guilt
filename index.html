                <p>How’d those pants come off? That escalated quickly! <span class="whiteText"> Not exactly your finest hour, but it was undeniably fun.</span>  Can’t take it back, and can’t shake the shame. The rarely discussed reality? Everyone’s done it. <span  class="whiteText" >Give yourself a break.</span></p>

                <p><span class="whiteText">Remember buying that gym membership eight months ago?</span>  Eight months! You were so excited, so motivated – you had the new clothes, new shoes, that  disgusting protein powder. <span class="whiteText">You’ve gone exactly zero times</span>  and now you’re out of breath on the stairs. At this point, you should just try faking an illness and see if you can get your money back.</p>

                <p><span class="whiteText">Never do coke, unless you’re trying to have an awesome time.</span>  Yeah, that night. Things got pretty wild after that. It’s hard to believe that was even you, but it was! You would love to say, “I wish I didn’t do that,” but who are you kidding, you loved it. <span class="whiteText"> Don’t waste time feeling bad, you’d do it again in a heartbeat.</span></p>

                <p> <span class="whiteText">Your kids use their phones non-stop. You know you shouldn’t let them – you have no idea what they’re doing – but finally, you have some peace and quiet.</span>  They want to play with you, but you’re tired, you had a long day, you take care of everything, and you get so little help. <span class="whiteText">You deserve some time for yourself. It’s okay.</span></p>
